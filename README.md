Features
- Angular Project: I chose this framework because it offers reactive forms which I find very helpfull to make the interface listen to changes in the data. For example when I upvote I update the corresponding control in the form and this control being binded the UI component makes it change.

-Persistence: data is stored in Local Storage of the browser everytime something in the data changes.
-Boostrap: I used this library because it is easy to make the layout responsive with the row, and col classes.
-Angular Material Icons
-Font Awesome icon: to include the Wikipedia icon

There are some banners I did not do, but I would use the same approach I used to make the other components.
